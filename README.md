# Data Visualization: Vehicle Crashes
Run this to plot the frequency of 'contributing factor 1' (that is, whether the cause is noted as environmental, human or vehicle) against in-State vs. out-of-State vehicle registration. 
A more accurate picture of the data is obtained by running tests on the full data set (185MB) made available by the NYS Department of Motor Vehicles. (https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Motor-Vehicle-Crashes-Vehicle-Information-Three-Ye/xe9x-a24f) as pictured below.  In that case, the column names will be in upper case and contain spaces. Edit the downloaded csv-formatted document to eliminate spaces and naming inconsistencies with the code.
